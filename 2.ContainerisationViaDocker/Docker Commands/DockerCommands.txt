(34)docker container rm currency-exchange
	#Remove the container from local repo

(36)docker network ls
	#Will show all docker realted networks
       # Bridge netwrok - is the default networkign mode in docker 
	# Containers preset in default bridge n/w cannot directly talk to each other using localhost
	# Another option is to use the host n/w which we will discuss further below.

(37)docker network inspect bridge
	# Inspect the bridge network

(38) Linking 2 microservices:
Currency Exchange:
 docker run -p 8000:8000 --name=currency-exchange mailsonymathew/currency-exchange-microservice-basic-java:0.0.1.RELEASE
		- url: http://localhost:8000/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR

Currency Conversion:
- REmove previous currency conversion container:
	- cmd: docker rm <container-id>

docker run -p 8100:8100 --name=currency-conversion --env CURRENCY_EXCHANGE_SERVICE_HOST=http://currency-exchange  --link currency-exchange mailsonymathew/currency-coversion-microservice-basic-java:0.0.1.RELEASE
		- url: http://localhost:8100/currency-conversion/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10
	# Thsi command is used to enable services to talk to each other within the bridge newtork by specifying environment of connector service and link of connector container.
	# This command will run the currency conversion service create a link between within the currency conversion to the currency exchange service.
	# The --env CURRENCY_EXCHANGE_SERVICE_HOST value specifies the container where the currency exchange service is found. Remeber that here we have to use the container name to which we want to link and the environment variable name should be the same as specified in the code . This env name and service name is specified as feign client in CurrencyExchangeServiceProxy.java in teh CurrencyExchange project as follows:
	@FeignClient(name = "currency-exchange", url = "${CURRENCY_EXCHANGE_SERVICE_HOST:http://localhost}:8000")
       # Hence in above command we are linking this feign command to set the environment variable 
       # the --link command specifies teh container to which the currency conversion service is linked. 
       # Note : link is not the recommnede dopton. Refer below commands to see recommeneded approaach.

(39) Host network:
	# Instead of bridge network we can use host n/w
	# However,  The host networking driver only works on Linux hosts, and is not supported on Docker Desktop for Mac, Docker Desktop for Windows, or Docker EE for  Windows Server. Refer -> https://docs.docker.com/network/host/
	# Hence this is a good option only for Linux based servers and cloud.
	# For our windows server, we will need to use a custom n/w

(40) USing a custom n/w:

- Note: Stop and remove above 2 containers

	(1) #create cutom n/w called currency-network:
		docker network create currency-network
			
	(2) #launch currency-exchange in the new network
		docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name=currency-exchange --network=currency-network mailsonymathew/currency-exchange-microservice-basic-java:0.0.1.RELEASE
			- url: http://localhost:8000/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR
	
	(3)# launch currency-conversion in new network without specifying the link
 	docker run -d -p 8100:8100 --env CURRENCY_EXCHANGE_SERVICE_HOST=http://currency-exchange --name=currency-conversion --network=currency-network 	mailsonymathew/currency-coversion-microservice-basic-java:0.0.1.RELEASE
			- url: http://localhost:8100/currency-conversion/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10
			
(41) docker-compose --version
	# Version of docker compose 

(42)docker-compose up
	# Create a docker-compose.yml file. Note - the name of the file must be 'docker-compose'.
	# Go to teh direcoty where this .yml file is available and execute this command. 

(43)docker-compose up -d 
	# Execute yml in detached mode.

		
(44)docker-compose down
	# Will bringdown containers specified in yml and also the custom n/w specified.

(45)docker-compose events
	# Will show all events being trigerred as part of executign teh yml file.

(46)docker-compose config
	# Will show the configurations specified in yml file.
	# Can also be used to d a review fo the yml fiel as it will highlight nay erros in the yml file.


(47)docker-compose images
	# Will show the images being used.

(48)docker-compose ps
	# Will show the containers being used.


(49)docker-compose top
	# Will show the top proceses running.

(50)docker-compose pause
	# Will pause all containers.

(51)docker-compose unpause
	# Will unpause all paused containers.

(50)docker-compose stop
	# Will stop all containers.

(51)docker-compose kill
	# Will kill all containers.

(52) Add a new tag to an image:
	# docker tag -p 5000:5000 -d mailsonymathew/06-todo-rest-api-h2-containerized:1.0.0.RELEASE mailsonymathew/06-todo-rest-api-h2-containerized:LATEST

(53) Restart container on Docker desktop restart:
	#docker run -p 5000:5000 -d --restart=always in28min/todo-rest-api-h2:1.0.0.RELEASE
	- default value of restart is no
